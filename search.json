    "text": "Intro && TL;DR\n如何将乐理学体系符号化并扩充到一个完备的形式体系上？\n实际上要讨论的，是对于全体音乐形式为什么不能统一的问题：也就是在一个世纪后的现代世界，在音乐的层面上对哥德尔工作的重新演绎。（拉康所谓不存在元语言 ，但若引入hyperobject,正可在某种现象学主张中获得诠释）。在目前的认识中，此处讨论的所谓纯声学所讨论的对象——正位于乐理学讨论的技术性的抽象之上——看起来有着某种怪异的现代哲学的风味。\n\nDissonance(Dissonant..?)\n\n名词之所以称为名词\n曾经试图在对音乐作品的解读中套用我熟悉的术语，也就是所谓副作用、函数式、递归、迭代、上下文云云，尽管这些词（相对）有效地表达了我要说的（但说实在的，却又并不是很强力），这让我试图重新挑选一些词来构造一个更好的体系…\n很多时候，如果你要说什么，总要从具体的记忆中抽取出动态的模式，然后才能得到具有普适性的结论。将这个过程搬运到机器上，是否可以类比成一类定理证明器的子集？某种意义上，用数学方法描述音乐表述在抽象的情感方面所对应的模式，可能与ACL2这类工具所进行着的工作非常相似。\n\n\n\n所谓BCL\n所谓乐理学就像是一种基于特定符号和其变换规则的数字游戏，偶尔一些透露出这种想法的作品被评论家们称之为”谱面逻辑的”，很多外行人都试图将这一行行无聊的符号和数字结合起来，运用种种复杂的数学工具，来证明这真的不是一种无聊的数字游戏——实际上这就是一种数字游戏，只不过如果你试图运用它于实际世界，那你需要添加上一些语言学上的规约（这一般称之为数理哲学）。\n\n\n就是Brian、Clash、Loser\n最开始实现上面想法的人的名字是巴赫，他似乎有意又无意地大量在其作品中运用了递归和迭代以及类型论的思想方法，这一方法的发展是如此地庞大以至于没有一种近代西方音乐理论是脱离了那种和谐的结构而存在的，这一切的改变直到斯特拉文斯基、拉威尔、勋伯格等人开始引入离调音，人们才逐渐地意识到原来巴赫的理论体系竟然还可以如此扩展。\n\n\n以及CCL\n当你听起来斯特拉文斯基的春之祭，以及同时代的一些非洲音乐，你会发现这些古怪的东西虽然听起来都相当古怪，但实际上却又莫名其妙地遵循着相似的规律——似乎有一台规律生成器不停地将不同批次的产品塞到这些位写曲子的作曲家们脑子里，实际上，这个机理显然是被人在语言学层面上挖掘出来的：乔姆斯基的生成语言学理论正是描述这一切的一种强有力的工具，而最早引入这一理论到乐理学中的人是伯恩斯坦。\n\n\n就是Cantor、Clear、Logic\n将这一思路发扬光大到一个非常恐怖的方面上的一个人叫做泽纳基斯，由于他的工作，他的频谱主义主张和计算机方法的引入实际上成为了序列主义音乐和统计学不解之缘的神秘的开始——\n（补充性质的说明）提及音乐，它的基本属性有音色、音高、强度、时值，这四者的种种量化实际上就成为了将上面提到的那台定理证明其所生产规则的一类实现，而对于这四个概念所做出抽象，有一个模型是这样的：情节是叙事事件本身的时间，而故事是叙述者讲述时所虚构的时间。当二者发生某种异质（悬置）——或者说实现了停顿与空白的描述——人们对此感到某种非常规的符号进入视野，种种感受由此发生——\n换句话说，音乐让人快乐就是由于它的不可捉摸（尽管这一过程仍然是有迹可循的）。对于这一难以捉摸的过程的一些表示法，许多人都有自己的见解，但大多都承认作为谱面逻辑时其可以使用分步的方式描述（就像是很多语言中语言中 Order of Evaluation 的概念）。\n\n\n没有DCL\n很多时候，数组的数据结构都很适用于描述一部乐曲的复杂状态的一类工作，（这有点像是APL的堆栈游戏），可以用简单的操作构造出很复杂的变化。不过我想，使用范畴这一类工具其抽象程度也许会更高也更合适，因为这增加了对结构本身的抽象（这在典型爵士乐中用得非常多见）。\n如果需要实现某种对于声音结构的序列的定理证明器，是否可以采用 Haskell 与 Fortran 结合的方式呢——\n\n\n或称，Don’t use Church’s Lambda Calculus\n关于递归方程的表示方法，最常见的属于SExpr一类，广义上而言，也就是 Lambda Calculus 一类，另一类属于 Term Rewriting 的方法论上（这实际上不能算做一类话题）。不过现在在这里讨论递归方程的表示法，无关于所谓更高的理论层次，用Haskell或者Axiom风格的强调类型的说法或许更精确。（我不想引入太多像lisp的东西，这让任何文章看起来都像计算机语言学教材）\n\n\n以小星星为例"

    "text": "LALO. I wanted a life.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor, violently). That’s not an answer. (Rapidly.) How did you do it? Did you give them some concoction, some poison? Or did you smother them with their pillows as they lay helplessly in bed? Where do the syringes and pills come in? Or are they just red herrings? Explain, prisoner at the bar. (Pause.) Did you kill them in cold blood? Was it planned step by step? Or was it a crime of passion? You tell us. Did you only use this knife? (Exhausted.) And finally, prisoner at the bar, why did you kill them? LALO. I felt they were persecuting me, harassing me.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Persecuting you? How? Harassing you? How?\nLALO. They never let me alone.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). But the witnesses testify that…\nLALO. The witnesses are lying …\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Are you contesting the statements made by the witnesses? LALO (Firmly). There was nobody there that night.\nBEBA (as judge. To LALO). The accused must be more precise in his answers. This is absolutely necessary. Are you sure you mean what you’ve just said? The Court demands both truth and precision.\nThe Court expects the accused to observe, without prejudice, these articles of procedure … The prosecution may proceed.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Let us now turn to your close relatives. Your grandmother, for example, your aunts and uncles, all your nearest and dearest. Did you see each other often? What kind of relationship did you have with them?\nLALO. None.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Why?\nLALO. Mum hated Dad’s family and Dad didn’t get along with Mum’s family.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Aren’t you exaggerating? LALO. None of our relations visited us … Mum didn’t want them to come round. She said they were jealous and hypocritical. Dad said the same thing about Mum’s relations. And they wouldn’t let us visit them either … CUCA (as public prosecutor). This doesn’t seem to have much basis in fact to me. Why … ? LALO. They kept on telling us that we were better people, that they were all common, that they had no class … CUCA (as public prosecutor). And you never tried to make contact with them?\nLALO. I tried once, but it didn’t work. CUCA (as public prosecutor). Do you know the witness Mrs. Angelita … ? (To the audience.) Her surname, please. Thank you. The witness Angela Martínez.\nLALO. Yes.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Did she go to your house, either before or after the incident in question? LALO. She did. Before. (Pause.) At around 6pm. CUCA (as public prosecutor). In her statement, she insists that you were all playing a strange game. What was the game that you played at home? (Pause.) Wasn’t it a bit… unhealthy? (Pause.) Answer. Wasn’t it a deviant game? LALO (firmly). I don’t know.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Your parents, according to my understanding, complained about you. LALO. All my life, as long as I can remember, I’ve been hearing the same complaints, the same sermons, the same nagging. CUCA (as public prosecutor). They must have had some reason for complaining. LALO. Sometimes they did, sometimes they didn’t… When a reason is hammered home over and over again, it stops being reasonable.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Were your parents really so demanding?\nLALO. I don’t understand.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). The question is this: what kind of relationship did you have with your parents?\nLALO. I’m sure I’ve told you already. They questioned me. They made demands on me. They spied on me.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). What questions did they ask? What demands did they make? Why were they spying?\nLALO (desperate). I don’t know. I don’t know. (Repeating in a mechanical voice.) Wash the dishes, wash the tablecloths, wash the shirts. Clean the vase, clean the bathroom, clean the floors. Don’t sleep, don’t dream, don’t read. You’re useless.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the court, do you believe these are motives strong enough to drive an individual to commit a murder?\nLALO (stammering). I wanted …\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). What did you want? (Pause.) Answer.\nLALO (sincerely). A life.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor. Sarcastically). And did your parents take your life away from you? (To the audience.) Objection, m’lord, the accused is evading the question.\nLALO (passionately). I wanted, I longed, I desperately longed to do things for myself.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). And did your parents stop you?\nLALO (confidently). Yes.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). How?\nLALO. They said I was a fool, a slob, a no-hoper.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor. With great patience). And what were the things you wanted to do? Would the accused care to elaborate?\nLALO (tormented, making a great effort, a little confused). It’s very hard … I don’t know. Things. You know? Things. How can I put it? I know they exist, that they’re out there … I just can’t at the moment. (CUCA smiles maliciously.) Look … I know it’s something else, it’s just that… (Confidently.) I tried every way I could to please them … I caught pneumonia once and I… No, I can’t tell you about that… I just… Things always went wrong for me. I didn’t want it to be that way but I couldn’t do anything else; and then…\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Then what?\nLALO. They shouted at me, they hit me, they punished me, endless hours locked in my room. They told me a thousand and one times I was better off dead, that they wanted to see me leave home to see how I coped and whether I would die of starvation.\nCUCA (with a cynical smile). Are you sure about what you’re saying?\nLALO. Yes.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Go on, go on.\nLALO. I was very unhappy.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Why?\nLALO. It felt like the house was caving in on me.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). I don’t understand? Exactly what do you mean?\nLALO. The walls, the carpets, the curtains, the lamps, the sofa where Dad took his siesta, and the bed, and the wardrobes, and the sheets … the whole lot, I hated them, I wanted them to go away.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). You hated the whole lot. And your parents? You hated your parents as well, didn’t you?\nLALO (distracted). Maybe I should have just run away. Gone anywhere: to hell or Timbuktu.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the court… LALO (continuing, as if hypnotized). One day, when I was playing with my sisters, I suddenly discovered… (Pause.)\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). What did you discover?\nLALO (in the same tone of voice as before). We were in the living room; no, I lie … We were in the back room. We were playing … Or rather, we were acting … (Smiles foolishly.) You might think it silly but… I was the father. No, that’s not true. I think at that moment I was the mother. It was just a game … But there, right at that moment, I had this idea… (Smiles foolishly again.)\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). What idea?\nLALO (smiling as before). It’s very simple, but it gets complicated. You never know whether you’re saying what you feel. I… (Moves his hands as if he were trying to explain things with this movement.) I knew what my folks were offering me wasn’t life, and could never be life. So I said to myself: ’If you want to live you have to …” (Stops and makes a stabbing gesture or clenches his fists as if tearing something apart.)\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). What did you feel at that moment?\nLALO. I don’t know. You tell me.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). Were you afraid?\nLALO. I think I was, just for a second.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). And then?\nLALO. Then I wasn’t.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). You got used to the idea?\nLALO. I got used to it.\nCUCA (as public prosecutor). What? (Banging the table.) Ladies and gentlemen, this is unprecedented.\nLALO. It’s true. I got used to it. (As LALO progresses through the monologue, he becomes transformed).\nIt sounds terrible, but… It’s not how I wanted it, but the idea kept on buzzing around in my head. At first, I wanted it to go away. Do you know what I mean? But it kept on telling me: ‘Kill your parents. Kill your parents.’ I thought I was going crazy, I swear. I jumped into bed. I started getting the shivers … I had a temperature. I thought I would pop like a balloon. I thought the devil was beckoning to me. I lay trembling under the blankets … You should have seen me … I couldn’t sleep. Not a wink night after night. It was dreadful. I saw death creeping up on me from behind the bed, from between the curtains, from inside the wardrobe. It became my shadow and whispered to me from inside the pillows: ‘Assassin.’ And then, as if by magic, it disappeared. And I sat in front of the mirror and saw my mother lying dead in her coffin and my father hanging by his neck laughing and shouting at me. And at night I felt my mother’s hands in the pillows, scratching my face. (Pause.) Every morning I woke up in pain. It was as if I were rising from the dead, clasped by two corpses which had been chasing me in my dreams. There were moments when I was tempted … but no … no … Leave home? No way! I knew what I was up against… I would always come back and then I would promise never to do it again. By then I was determined never again to embark on that crazy adventure. Anything but that! Then I had the idea of arranging the house in my own way, of running things myself… The living room is not the living room, I said to myself. The living room is the kitchen. The bedroom is not the bedroom. The bedroom is the bathroom. (Short pause.) What else could I do? If I didn’t do that, I would end up destroying everything. Everything. Because everything was complicit, everything was plotting against me; everything knew my every thought. If I sat down in a chair, the chair wasn’t the chair but my father’s corpse. If I picked up a glass of water, I felt that what I had in my hands was my dead mother’s damp neck. If I played with a vase, an enormous knife would suddenly fall out of it. If I cleaned the carpets, I could never finish the job because they turned into an enormous clot of blood. (Pause.) Haven’t you ever felt like that? I was suffocating, suffocating. I didn’t know where I was or what it was all about. And who could I talk to? Was there anyone I could trust? I was stuck in a deep hole and there was no way out… (Pause.) But I had a strange idea that I could save myself… I don’t know what from . .. Anyway, it’s just an expression … You try to explain the whole thing and you almost… usually you can’t… Perhaps I wanted to save myself from the suffocating, from being shut in … Soon after, without knowing why, things began to change. I heard a voice one day, but I didn’t know where it was coming from … And then I heard my sisters laughing and joking all round the house.\nAnd mixed in with their laughter I heard thousands of voices repeating in unison: ‘Kill them. Kill them.’ No, I’m not just making it up. I swear it’s true. (As if inspired.) From then on I knew what I had to do. Gradually I realized that everything, the carpets, the bed, the wardrobes, the mirror, the vases, the glasses, the spoons and my own shadow, they were all murmuring, telling me: ‘Kill your parents.’ (He says it in an almost musical ecstasy.) ‘Kill your parents.’ The whole house, everything, everything was pushing me towards this heroic act. (Pause.)\nCUCA (violently). I’m leaving. You’re cheating. LALO. We’ve got to see it through to the end. CUCA. I can’t let you … LALO. You’ve tried to make it go your way as well.\nCUCA. I can’t believe you’re doing this. We each have a part; we agreed.\nLALO. Is that so? All right then …\nBEBA (as judge, banging her gavel). Order! Silence in court!\nCUCA (as mother. To BEBA). Officer, forgive my interruption; but I must ask for a thorough investigation of this case, right from the beginning. I demand a retrial. That’s why I’m here. I want to make a statement. My son is making himself out to be a victim, but that’s the complete opposite of the truth. I demand that justice be done. (BEBA starts to repeat the tac-tac of the typewriter. Exaggerating.) If you knew what this beast has done to our lives. It’s so dreadful, so…\nBEBA (as officer. To CUCA). Go on …\nLALO (almost out of part). But Mum, I… (LALO feels cornered.) I… I swear …\nCUCA (as mother). Don’t you swear at me. You want to come across as a fool, but I know your tricks, your games. I know them because I gave birth to you. Nine months of dizziness, vomiting, aches, and pains. And they were just the warnings of your arrival. Are you trying to confuse me? Why are you swearing these things to me? Do you think you’ve won over your audience? Do you think you can save yourself? Well tell me, save yourself from what? (Roars with laughter.) What planet are you living on, sonny? (Mockingly.) Oh, my little angel, I’m so sorry for you. You really are, well, I won’t say what you are … (To BEBA.) Do you know something, officer? One day he got it into his head that we should rearrange the whole house the way he wanted it… As soon as I heard this ridiculous idea, I refused to listen to another word on the subject. His father hit the roof. You can’t imagine what it looked like … The ashtray on the chair. The vase lying on the floor. Awful! And then he started singing at the top of his voice, running all round the house: The living room is not the living room. The living room is the kitchen.’ When that happened I pretended not to hear, as if I were listening to the rain. (To LALO.) You’ve only told the bits which interest you. Why don’t you tell the rest of the story? (Mockingly.) You’ve told them about your martyrdom, now tell them about ours, your father’s and mine. Let me refresh your memory. (To BEBA, transformed.) Your Honor, if you knew the tears I have shed, the humiliation I have suffered, the hours of anguish, the sacrifices … Just look at these hands … It makes me sick to look at them. (On the verge of tears.) My hands … If you had seen them before I got married … Now I’ve lost everything: my youth, my happiness, all my little pleasures. I’ve sacrificed everything for this animal. (To LALO.) Aren’t you ashamed? Do you still think you’ve done something heroic? (Disgusted.) You wretch. I don’t know how I could have carried you for so long in my belly. I don’t know why I didn’t drown you at birth. (BEBA bangs her gavel.)"

Do you think I don’t have a right to live? Do you think I’m going to spend my whole life in perpetual agony? Your father doesn’t care about me and neither do you. Where will I end up? Yes, I know you’re waiting for me to die, but I won’t give you that satisfaction. I’ll shout to the neighbours, to everyone in the street. You’ll see.\nThat will be my revenge. (Shouting.) Help! Help! They’re killing me. (Bursts into tears.) I’m a poor old woman dying of loneliness. (BEBA bangs her gavel.) Yes, your Honour, I’m imprisoned by these four dirty walls. I never see the light of day. My children don’t care. I’m withered, wilting … (As if she were looking at herself in a mirror. Starts stroking her face and ends up slapping it.) Look at this skin. Look at these wrinkles. (Pointing to her wrinkles with rancour and disgust. To LALO.) You’ll get them one day. All I want is for you to go through the same as I have. (Haughtily.)

(With a faint smile.) Oh, I’m sorry, your Honour … I could have done it… But it was just a silly mistake. (Laughs crudely.) I got completely hooked on this red taffeta dress I saw in the window of the New Bazaar. It was so divine. My husband was earning a pittance. You can’t imagine … I had to perform miracles every month just to make ends meet. So, as I was saying, your Honour, I was mad about that dress. I had to have it. I had dreams about it. I even saw it in my soup. At last, one day I decided to buy the dress with the housekeeping money. So I made up a story.\nBEBA (as judge). What kind of story?\nCUCA (as mother. With great self-confidence). When Albert got home, drunk as usual, I said to him: look, dear, will you have a word with your son … (Goes up to BEBA to whisper in her ear.) Because I think he’s stolen some money from us.\nBEBA (as judge). Why did you do it?\nCUCA (as mother. Vulgarly). I don’t know … It was easier that way … (She finishes the story with a flourish.) So Albert took off his belt and beat poor little Lalo … Oh, I hate to think how many times he beat him … In fact, he was completely innocent, but… I wanted that red dress so much! (Going up to LALO.) Do you forgive me, my son?\nLALO (hard). There’s nothing to forgive.\nCUCA (as mother. Slightly hysterical). Have some respect, Lalo. (In a dramatic tone of voice.) I’ve changed. I’m fat and ugly now … Ah, this body!\nLALO. Don’t think about it.\nCUCA (as mother. With authority). Show some respect, I said.\nLALO. I was only playing around.\nCUCA (as mother. Hard and imperious). Well, don’t play with me. Your father is an old fool who’s chasing something which doesn’t exist. So are you. Let him be a lesson to you … He thinks he’s Superman, but actually he’s a nobody. He’s always been a failure. He’s always been all talk, and he thinks he can carry on like that. Sometimes I wish he’d lie down and die. Why did I have to get hitched to a man who couldn’t offer me a better life than this? (Pause.) Come on. (Pause.) If it wasn’t for me, your Honour, this house wouldn’t even be standing … It was all me…\nLALO (as father. In an assured, almost frightening voice). She’s lying, your Honour.\nCUCA (as mother. To LALO). How dare you?\nLALO (as father. To BEBA). It’s true. She’s trying to paint everything black. She sees only the motes in the eyes of others, not the beam in her own. I have been at fault at times as a parent. And so has she. (In a more assured tone of voice.) Like all parents we’ve done some things which have been unfair and other things which have been unforgivable.\nCUCA (as mother). You used to come home with lipstick on your collar.\nLALO (as father). Shut up. You don’t want me to tell the truth.\nCUCA (as mother). Your honour, he was always drinking, he used to bring his friends over at all hours of the night…\nLALO (as father). Who wears the trousers in our house?\nCUCA (as mother). I’m in charge of the house.\nLALO (as father). There. ‘I’m in charge of the house.’ Yes, you, you’re in charge all right. That’s all your life comes down to. You’ve made fun of me. You’ve humiliated me. That’s the truth. Domination. (Short pause.) I’ve been an idiot, a complete asshole, if you’ll excuse my French.\nCUCA (as mother). Well done. At least you admit it.\nLALO (as father). What’s the point of denying it? (Pause. Ordering his thoughts.) I went into marriage with few illusions. If I said I was pinning all my hopes on marriage, I’d be both exaggerating and lying. I went into it like most people, thinking that it would sort out a few problems: clothes, food, stability … some company and… well… a few little liberties. (Kicking himself inside.) Idiot! You idiot! (Pause.) I never thought it would turn out like it did.\nCUCA (as mother). You never thought, full stop. ‘You take the low road and I’ll take the high road.’ That’s what a lot of people think. But I was different.\nLALO (as father). She’s right there. She certainly was very different. The problems started a few days before the wedding: the church wasn’t smart enough, the train on your dress wasn’t long enough. And your sisters said this, and your mother said that, and your cousin said the other, and your aunt said something else, and your friends didn’t agree at all, and your granny thought we should have invited the so-and-sos, and that the cake should have been ten rather than nine tiers high, and that your friends should come from better backgrounds …\nCUCA (as mother). Go on, go on. Spit it all out, get it all out of your system. At last I can see that you hate me.\nLALO (as father). Yes, I do. And I don’t know why. But I know I do. When we were just going out you went to bed with me because you knew that was the only way you could catch me. And that’s the truth. CUCA (as mother). Carry on, carry on. Don’t stop.\nLALO (as father). You didn’t want kids. You hated them. But no way could you stay single. No way. You had to catch a husband. It didn’t matter who. Having one was all that mattered.\nCUCA (as mother. Going up to him furiously). I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.\nLALO (as father). A husband made you feel secure. A husband made you respectable. (Ironically.)\nRespectable … (Pause.) I can’t quite explain … Anyway, life is like that, so if you want to…\nCUCA (as mother). Lies, lies, lies.\nLALO (as father). Will you let me finish?\nCUCA (out of part). You’re cheating again.\nLALO (as father). You don’t want people to know the truth.\nCUCA (out of part). I’m talking about something else.\nLALO (as father). You’re scared of seeing it through to the end.\nCUCA (out of pan). You’re trying to crush me.\nLALO (as father). And you? What have you been doing? Tell me. What have you done to me? And to them? (Mocking.) ‘I’m growing ugly, Albert. I’m in the family way. We can’t bring them up on your salary.’ (Pause.) And I didn’t know the reasons, the real reasons. And today, I say to you: ‘Put your hand on your heart and answer this question: Did you ever love me?’ (Pause.) Oh well, don’t say anything. I can see clearly now. It’s taken years to sink in. ‘Albert, those children … I can’t handle them. You take care of them.’ As time passed, your demands grew greater, and your selfishness grew with them. (Pause.) And me, in the office, with my figures, and the gossip and the friends who came up to me and said: ‘How long are you going to put up with this, ( mate?’\nCUCA starts singing: ’The living room is not the living room, the living room is the kitchen. The bedroom is not the bedroom, the bedroom is the bathroom. CUCA’s singing andLALO’s words should proceed in counterpoint. BEBA starts singing, first as a growl and then gradually becoming a sweet, simple, almost naive song.\nLALO (continues, mockingly). And you? ‘Your sister called today. She’s so nosey. Oh, these children. Look at my hands: the washing up did this. I’m losing my mind, Albert, I wish I were dead.’ And then came your tears and the children started screaming and I thought I was going mad and everything started spinning … I used to escape from the house, sometimes at midnight, and go for a few drinks, and I felt like I was drowning, drowning. (Pause. Without taking a breath.) And other women were there and I didn’t dare think about them … And I felt a terrible urge to leave, to fly away, to break with everything. (Pause.) But I was afraid, and fear paralysed me and I couldn’t make up my mind and I got stuck between two stools. I thought one thing and I did another. It’s terrible to have to admit it. And only to realise at the end. (Pause.) I couldn’t do it. (To the audience.) Lalo, if you want to do it, you can. (Pause.) Now I ask myself why I didn’t live out all my thoughts, all my desires. And I have to reply: because I was afraid, afraid, afraid.\nCUCA (as mother. Sarcastically). Well, honey, you can’t blame me for that. (Pause, defiantly.) And what did you want me to do? Those children were a nightmare. They turned my house into a pigsty. Lalo ripped the curtains and smashed the crockery. Beba wasn’t content with tearing apart the pillows… And you expected to come home and find everything tickety-boo. Do you remember when Lalo peed all over the living room? You threw a fit and said. “That never happened in my home.’ Was that my fault as well? Eh? I used to put a chair here. (Moves a chair.) And I would find it over here. (Moves the chair to another place.) What was I supposed to do?\nLALO (as father. Beaten). The house had to be cleaned. (BEBA stops singing.) Yes … The furniture had to be changed… (Pause. With great melancholy.) We really should have found a new house. (Pause. Slowly.) But we’re old now and we can’t. We are dead. (Long pause. Violently.) You always thought you were better than me.\nCUCA (as mother). I’ve wasted my life away on you.\nLALO (as fat her. Vengefully). You can’t escape, love. Carry on. Carry on. Carry on.\nCUCA (as mother. Sobbing). You pathetic pen-pusher. I wish you were dead.\nBEBA (as LALO. Shouting and moving in circles around the stage). Throw out the carpets. Pull down the curtains. The living room is not the living room. The living room is the kitchen. The bedroom is not the bedroom. The bedroom is the bathroom. (BEBA and LALO are at opposite ends of the stage with their backs to the audience. LALO doubles up slowly with a piercing scream.) Ayyyyyy! (Sobbing.) I can see my dead mother. I can see my father with his throat cut. Tear this house down.\nLong pause.\nLALO. Open the door. LALO falls to his knees.\nCUCA slowly gets up, walks over to the door upstage and opens it. Pause. Goes over to the table and picks up the knife.\nBEBA (in a normal tone of voice). How do you feel? CUCA (in a normal tone of voice). Stronger.\nBEBA. Satisfied?\nCUCA. Yes.\nBEBA. Really?\nCUCA. Really.\nBEBA. Are you ready to do it again?\nCUCA. You know the answer to that.\nBEBA. One day we'll do it for real.\nCUCA (interrupting). Without anything going wrong.\nBEBA. Were you surprised you managed to do it?\nCUCA. Everything's surprising.\nLALO (sobbing). Oh, Beba, Cuca, if only love could do it... If only love ... Because in spite of everything, I love them.\nCUCA (playing with the knife). That's ridiculous.\nBEBA (to CUCA). Poor little thing, let him be.\nCUCA (to BEBA. Laughing mockingly). Look at him. (To LALO.) That's how I like to see you.\nBEBA (serious again). All right. Now it's my turn.\nCurtain."
